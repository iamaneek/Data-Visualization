Background:
Minard produced a map of Napoleon’s March to Russia in 1812. In his map, Minard showed how the French army advanced and retreated to and
from Moscow (then Moscou), Russia. The retreat-to-every-advance was a tactic which was adapted by Czar of Russia as Napoleon’s troop
marched towards Russia. The Russians retreated with the French army in October. Napoleon had to retreat his army after reaching Moscow 
as the temperature dropped severely due to winter. This was accompanied by the suffering of his troops who lacked food, suffered 
Zymotic diseases, Wounds and Injuries. Ultimately, Napoleon had to return to France.

Previously, the following has been visualized:
•	Variation of temperature from October to December
•	Advance of Napoleon’s troops from France to Russia [visualized in yellow]
•	Retreat of Napoleon’s troops from Russia [visualized in brown]

The visualization has been explained below:
Language/Tool used: R/ RStudio
Libraries used: ggplot2, ggmap, ggrepel, tidyverse, gridExtra, reshape2, HistData, scales
The data has been visualization through the following methods:
1.	Data collection: Actual historical data has been retrieved from HistData library viz. Minard.troops, Minard.cities, Minard.temp
2.	Plot for troops and cities:
•	Specified European region has been visualized in the background with the help of ggmap library
•	The plot for direction type (A or R) has been visualized along with survivors’ size
•	Using geom_point, the cities were plotted on the visualization
•	To maintain aesthetics, specific hex codes were used for colours 
3.	Plot for temperature:
•	Using ggplot for Minard.temp , visualization was generated
•	Size was adjusted accordingly and the visualization was labelled
•	Specific co-ordinate system was set using coord_cartesian
4.	Combination of the two plots:
•	Using rbind, two plots were combined
•	Aspect ratio of 2:1 was set
